### Helpful libraries

Here are some libraries that can help you get started with your testing. Check out the `build.gradle` file to see how to add them to your project.

* [JUnit4](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/getting-started)
Java test framework.
* [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/)
Fluent style assertions for Java. This makes the assertions, and in the end the test case, more readable.
* [MockWebServer](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver)
Mock your backend in a simple way! For integration and UI testing you can simulate responses, errors and timeouts to make sure your code is ready for whatever the backend throws at it.
* [Espresso](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/)
UI Testing framework from the Android Testing Support Library.
* [Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric)
Very helpful test framework for integration testing when the Android SDK is involved.
